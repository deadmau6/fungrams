# The Fungrams Doctrine 

This is a not a repo! It is, what I call a "My Code Gallery". It is supposed to be  like an Art Gallery, but its more like a sketch book. Ultimately, as the name suggests, this repo is full of random programs and unfinished projects I had fun making on my own person time.

### Final Warning:

Engineered perfection is _fanciful_, life is _messy_, and _"free"_ time is a elusive. Therefore this repo is maintained by pure chaos! Good luck straining this spagetti farm. You'll find no conventions here, especially for _"names"_.
If you run something and it errors then that feature is depreciated. If nothing happens at all then the program is probably waiting for the secret key command(`Ctrl-C`). And if by some miracle there is a coherent output, then congradulations you did it! That's it, that's all it does.

### Not Convinced? Check out these ~~distressing flaws~~ selling points!

 * Reverse Compatability - here at *Fungrams* we don't dwell on the past, but instead look towards a better future. Words like _Reverse_ and _Backwards_ have been physically expunged from our vocabulary.

 * Testing - things like "stress" testing or "pen" testing can be hard on the codebase, that's why we only use **_Real Time QA testing_**! It is safer and each time you run the code it is put to the test!

 * Code Coverage - here at *Fungrams* we don't believe in restricting / covering our code up. Instead we pratice *Open Code* or **_Code Exposure_**!

 * Continuous Integration - more like **_Continuous Imagination_**!

 * This is an *Organic*, *Comment-free*, Codebase. Clone with caution and run at your own risk.

 * **And remember! Have FUN**..-grams
